Title: BioThings Client (https://github.com/biothings/BioThingsClient.R)
Description: This is a unified R client for all "BioThings APIs" (more at http://biothings.io). 
    BioThings APIs are a collection of high-performance APIs for variety of aggregated entity-type
    specific annotations, such as genes, variants, chemicals, drugs etc. (so  called "BioThings").
    It also provides a SDK (BioThings SDK) for users to build their own BioThings API for any biological
    entity types. This client provides a generic R library for existing BioThings APIs as well as the new
    BioThings APIs will be created in the future, either by us or users.
