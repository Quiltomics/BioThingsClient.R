The [BioThings APIs](http://biothings.io/) provide query and retrieve annoation of genes, variants, chemicals and taxons. 


## Package Usage
This package has S4 methods for accessing each API, as well as an R6 class that is extensible so that as other APIs are made, a configuration can be passed and used to query and retrieve annotation from said APIs. The S4 methods are also extensible by providing a configuration object like the included `biothings_clients` configuration, and then using the `getThing` and `getThings` methods.


### Annotations
Each API (gene, taxon, variant and chemical - when this was written) has a set of methods for getting annotations. Additionally, there are the generic `getThing` and `getThings` methods.


#### Example: `getGene` and `getGenes`
These methods can be used with a defined `BioThings` class object or with none (missing).

With a defined `BioThings` object (see next example for output):
```
> biothings <- BioThings()
> # Suppress messages
> slot(biothings, "verbose") <- FALSE
> getGene("1017", biothings = biothings)
> getGenes(c("1017","1018","ENSG00000148795"), biothings = biothings)
```

Without (output trimmed):
```
> getGene("1017")
[[1]]
[[1]]$`_id`
[1] "1017"

[[1]]$`_score`
[1] 22.32558
...(trimmed for space)

> getGenes(c("1017","1018","ENSG00000148795"))
[[1]]
[[1]]$`_id`
[1] "1017"

[[1]]$`_score`
[1] 22.32558
...(trimmed for space)


[[2]]
[[2]]$`_id`
[1] "1018"
...(trimmed for space)
```

Users can also specify `fields` and the type of return object. However, due to the size of some API responses, the default is a list (denoted by `"records"`) and we recommend only requesting `"data.frame"` when also specifing fields.

```
> getGenes(c("1017","1018","ENSG00000148795"),
           fields = c("symbol","name","taxid","entrezgene"),
           return.as = "data.frame")
   _id   _score entrezgene                                           name  symbol
1 1017 22.32558       1017                      cyclin dependent kinase 2    CDK2
2 1018 22.32596       1018                      cyclin dependent kinase 3    CDK3
3 1586 23.35202       1586 cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 CYP17A1
  taxid           query
1  9606            1017
2  9606            1018
3  9606 ENSG00000148795
```


### Queries
The APIs also have query endpoints, so a user can provide query terms and receive annotations in that form. The `query` and `queryMany` methods are generic and rely on input of a key for the `biothings_clients` configuration for specification of which API to use. Just like the generic annotation methods, these methods can be used with an updated or customized configuration.

#### Example: `query` and `queryMany`

`query`:
```
> query("sp2", "gene")
[[1]]
[[1]]$max_score
[1] 457.1937

[[1]]$took
[1] 5

[[1]]$total
[1] 10

[[1]]$hits
[[1]]$hits[[1]]
[[1]]$hits[[1]]$`_id`
[1] "6668"
...(output trimmed)
```

`queryMany`:
```
> genes <- c('1053_at', '117_at', '121_at', '1255_g_at', '1294_at')
> # Notice how "gene" is the second argument in the queryMany function
> queryMany(genes, "gene", scopes=c("symbol", "reporter", "accession"),
            fields=c("entrezgene", "uniprot"), species='human', returnall=TRUE)
Finished
$response
$response[[1]]
$response[[1]]$`_id`
[1] "5982"

$response[[1]]$`_score`
[1] 22.32529

$response[[1]]$entrezgene
[1] 5982

$response[[1]]$uniprot
$response[[1]]$uniprot$`Swiss-Prot`
[1] "P35250"
...(output trimmed)
```

#### Example: Using `fetch_all`
Some queries return thousands of results. Use `fetch_all` to get all of them.

```
> faquery <- query('_exists_:pdb', "gene", fetch_all = TRUE, fields = 'pdb')
Getting additional records. Took: 536
Getting additional records. Took: 484
Getting additional records. Took: 301
Getting additional records. Took: 300
Getting additional records. Took: 409

Getting additional records. Took: 147
Getting additional records. Took: 46
> str(faquery)
List of 8176
 $ :List of 3
  ..$ _id   : chr "23211"
  ..$ _score: num 1.55
  ..$ pdb   : chr "2CQE"
 $ :List of 3
  ..$ _id   : chr "5888"
  ..$ _score: num 1.55
  ..$ pdb   : chr [1:6] "1B22" "1N0W" "5H1B" "5H1C" ...
...(output trimmed)
```
### Metadata and Metadata Fields

Users can also retrieve information about metadata for an API with `getMetadata`:
```
> getMetadata("gene")
[[1]]
[[1]]$source
NULL

[[1]]$stats
[[1]]$stats$entrez_retired
[1] 201591

[[1]]$stats$ensembl_prosite
[1] 725969

[[1]]$stats$ensembl_pfam
[1] 1174908

[[1]]$stats$entrez_gene
[1] 19752422
...(output trimmed)
```

As well as metadata fields with `getFields`:
```
> getFields("gene") # Beware, produces a lot of output
```
